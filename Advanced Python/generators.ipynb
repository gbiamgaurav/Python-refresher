      "Presidential elections were held in the United States on November 5, 2024.[a] The Republican Party's ticket—Donald Trump, who was the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021, and JD Vance, the junior U.S. senator from Ohio—defeated the Democratic Party's ticket—Kamala Harris, the incumbent U.S. vice president, and Tim Walz, the 41st governor of Minnesota.[4][7]\n",
      "\n",
      "The incumbent president, Joe Biden of the Democratic Party, initially ran for re-election as the party's presumptive nominee.[8][9] However, Biden's performance in the June 2024 presidential debate intensified concerns about his age and health, leading to calls within his party for him to leave the race.[10] After initially declining to withdraw, Biden ended his re-election campaign on July 21.[11] Biden endorsed Harris as his successor,[12] and she was voted the party's nominee by Democratic delegates on August 5. Harris selected Walz as her running mate.[13][14]\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump, who lost the 2020 presidential election to Biden, ran for re-election again.[15] He was nominated during the 2024 Republican National Convention alongside his running mate, Vance. The Trump campaign made many false and misleading statements, including the claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.[16][17][18][19] Trump engaged in anti-immigrant fearmongering[b] and promoted conspiracy theories.[20][21] His political movement was described by historians and former Trump administration officials as authoritarian, featuring parallels to fascism and using dehumanizing rhetoric toward his political opponents.[c][d]\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump won the Electoral College with 312 electoral votes, while Harris received 226. Trump won every swing state, including the first win of Nevada by Republicans since 2004; he also won all of the states that he had won in 2020.[22][23][24] Trump won the national popular vote with a plurality of 49.8%,[25] making him the first Republican to win the popular vote since George W. Bush in 2004.[26][27] Relative to the 2020 election, he improved his vote share among working-class voters, particularly among young men, those without college degrees, and Hispanic voters.[28] Trump became the first person since Grover Cleveland in 1892[29] to be elected to a non-consecutive second term.\n",

      "According to polls, the most important issues for voters were the economy,[30] healthcare,[31] democracy,[32][33] foreign policy (notably U.S. support for Israel and for Ukraine),[34] illegal immigration,[35][36] abortion,[37][38][39] and climate change.[40][41][42] Education and LGBTQ rights were also prominent issues in the campaign.[43][44] Polled voters consistently cited the economy, particularly inflation, as the most important issue in the election.[30][40] Analysts attributed Harris' loss to the 2021–2023 inflation surge,[45][46] a global anti-incumbent wave,[47][48][49][50] the unpopularity of the Biden administration,[51][52][53][54] Trump's gains with the working class,[55][56][57] and immigration issues.\n",

On March 4, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Trump v. Anderson that states cannot determine eligibility for a national election under Section 3. The Court held that only Congress has the authority to disqualify candidates, or to pass legislation that allows courts to do so.[70]\n",
